# Investigations

## ProcedureRequest

1 ProcedureRequest within the TPP file, but nothing within the PS Adaptor.

The PS Adaptor converts a `PlanStatement` element to a `ProcedureRequest` resource,
but there isn't a `PlanStatement` element provided by TPP.

## DiagnosticReport


### Status field

PS Adaptor specifies the status as `unknown`. TPP as `final`.

### Conclusion field

TPP specify a conclusion field, which includes information which isn't present in XML.
PS Adaptor has no conclusion field.

### Identifier field

TPP doesn't include the PMIP identifier.

Second identifier in this example below.
```json
"identifier" : [
    {
        "system" : "https://PSSAdaptor/2167888433",
        "value" : "C5137634-2473-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0"
    },
    {
        "system" : "2.16.840.1.113883.2.1.4.5.5",
        "value" : "1013/CH2101117I/200203301621"
    }
]
```

### Issued field

TPP is using a more precise issued time, but I can't see that value within the XML.

### Category field

TPP sometimes provides a category value, whereas we never provide one.
```json
"category": [
    {
        "coding": [
            {
                "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/diagnostic-service-sections",
                "code": "PAT",
                "display": "Pathology (gross & histopath, not surgical)"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

### Performer field

TPP sometimes provides a performer value, whereas we never provide one.
```json
"performer": [
    {
        "actor": {
            "reference": "Organization/f000000000000000_c746100000000000"
        }
    }
]
```


### TODO: Why are there 10 DiagnosticReports which can't be matched

## Specimen

TODO: Report hasn't tried to do any matching for Specimen ðŸ˜¿

Emis Entries = 17 vs PS Entries = 16

EMIS Entry c200000000000000_1f6c000000000000_1 vs PS Entry c200000000000000_1f6c000000000000_1
MISSING: Property note is missing in PS Entry (Emis Value : [object Object])
Note is appearing inconsistently on both TPP and PS side. In this case, it appears on TPP side without any entry on PS side. XML also doesn't include anything.

EMIS Entry c200000000000000_0f6c000000000000_1 vs PS Entry c200000000000000_0f6c000000000000_1
MISSING: Property collection is missing in PS Entry (Emis Value : [object Object])
When collection is empty it appears as empty collection on TPP ([]) but no entry on PS side.

MISSING Entry: EMIS entry with ID c200000000000000_6f6c000000000000_1 has not been found in the PS enties
- Potential Specimen match C515E756-2473-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0
- Potential Specimen match C5137647-2473-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0
For some missing specimen in TPP there are quite a few entries with the same accessionIdentifier values which PS identifies as potential matches.

## Observation

### DIFF: Array Property resource.performer does not have equal length with PS property resource.performer (2 != 1)

TPP include a reference to the organisation within the Observation.performer array.

### DIFF: Emis Value of resource.valueQuantity.unit does not match PS Property (mU/L != m{U}/L)

m{U}/L is specified as the unit within the `ObservationStatement / value [@unit]`.

### NEW: Property code is not present in the EMIS data (PS Value : [iU]/L)

PS Adaptor
```json
{
    "code" : "m{U}/L",
    "system" : "http://unitsofmeasure.org",
    "unit" : "m{U}/L",
    "value" : 12
}
```

TPP
```json
{
    "value": 12,
    "unit": "mU/L"
}
```

### NEW: Property comparator is not present in the EMIS data (PS Value : <=)

PS Adaptor
```json
"referenceRange" : [
    {
        "high" : {
            "comparator" : "<=",
            "value" : 14
        },
        "low" : {
            "comparator" : "<=",
            "value" : 10
        }
    }
],
```

TPP
```json
"referenceRange": [
    {
        "low": {
            "value": 10
        },
        "high": {
            "value": 14
        }
    }
]
```

### NEW: Property interpretation is not present in the EMIS data (PS Value : [object Object])

```json
"interpretation" : {
    "coding" : [
        {
            "code" : "L",
            "display" : "Low",
            "system" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0078"
        }
    ],
    "text" : "Below low reference limit"
},
```

###Â MISSING: Property text is missing in PS Entry (Emis Value : Plasma TSH level)

```json
"code": {
    "coding": [
        {
            "extension": [
                {
                    "url": "https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/Extension-coding-sctdescid",
                    "extension": [
                        {
                            "url": "descriptionId",
                            "valueId": "2575751000000115"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
            "code": "1022801000000102",
            "display": "Plasma TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) level"
        }
    ],
    "text": "Plasma TSH level"
},
```

```xml
<code code="XaELW" codeSystem="2.16.840.1.113883.2.1.3.2.4.14" displayName="Plasma TSH level">
    <originalText>Plasma TSH level</originalText>
    <translation code="1022801000000102" codeSystem="2.16.840.1.113883.2.1.3.2.4.15" displayName="Plasma TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) level"/>
    <translation code="442X.00" codeSystem="2.16.840.1.113883.2.1.6.2" displayName="Plasma TSH level"/>
</code>
```

### MISSING: Property text is missing in PS Entry (Emis Value : < 4)

PS Adaptor
```json
"referenceRange" : [
    {
        "high" : {
            "comparator" : "<=",
            "value" : 4
        }
    }
],
```

TPP
```json
"referenceRange": [
    {
        "text": "< 4"
    }
]
```

### MISSING: Property related is missing in PS Entry (Emis Value : [object Object])

```json
"related": [
    {
        "type": "has-member",
        "target": {
            "reference": "Observation/5000000000000000_7dfb070000000000"
        }
    }
]
```

Not sure why the related is missing from the PS Adaptor version?!  Suppose, PS Adaptor doesn't think it is a header.

### Mapping of laboratory results quite different between the two.

Hard to match up these because the way lab results are generated is so different between TPP and PS.

- 52 Comment Note from the Patient Switcher.  A lot of these are coded as "laboratory" within TPP.

- 16 Laboratory Test Observable from the Patient Switcher
- However within the TPP, they appear to be created as 16 Comment Notes instead

### Test result comment getting cut off

- C515E712 comment = "second day after the expected menstruation".

Beginning of sentence is cut off for some reason.


### Not within TPP extract, but unclear why.

- C51D1317 - "HIV Negative"
- C51D1345 - "Fluorescent treponemal antibody test"

### Within TPP extract, but marked as a DiagnosticReport

- C513762C

### Unsure what's going on with this one.

Unclear where it is getting its data from, and also unclear why "laboratory" category is added twice.

I suspect this is a bug within a PS Adaptor, but would need to do more investigation.

- C5137632


### Degraded entries

There are 4 degraded entries within the PS Adaptor that have no originalText copied over, e.g. `Chlamydia Positive`.

- C51D131B
- C51D1332
- C51D1333
- C51D1345
