# Investigations

## ProcedureRequest

1 ProcedureRequest within the TPP file, but nothing within the PS Adaptor.

The PS Adaptor converts a `PlanStatement` element to a `ProcedureRequest` resource,
but there isn't a `PlanStatement` element provided by TPP.

_Martin_: Suspicion is that GP2GP spec didn't originally anticipate/ask for this information to be included. Worth asking John McDonald?

## DiagnosticReport

### Status field

PS Adaptor specifies the status as `unknown`. TPP as `final`.

_Martin_: Converting it as desgined. TPP appear to have implemented it to a more granular level within their outputs, but given the GP2GP output we process we can't give anything more specific.

### Conclusion field

TPP specify a conclusion field, which includes information which isn't present in XML.
PS Adaptor has no conclusion field.

_Martin_: Not concerned about this specifically. As long as each `NarrativeStatement / text` content is being copied across.

### Identifier field

TPP doesn't include the PMIP identifier.

Second identifier in this example below.
```json
"identifier" : [
    {
        "system" : "https://PSSAdaptor/2167888433",
        "value" : "C5137634-2473-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0"
    },
    {
        "system" : "2.16.840.1.113883.2.1.4.5.5",
        "value" : "1013/CH2101117I/200203301621"
    }
]
```

_Martin_: Keep this behaviour. Technically speaking the `OID` should have a [prefix in front][Identifier] of it within the `system` field, e.g. `urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.16.4.3.2.5`.

[Identifier]: http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/datatypes.html#Identifier

### Issued field

TPP is using a more precise issued time, but I can't see that value within the GP2GP XML.

_Martin_: We've seen this before within the GP2GP, unlikely to be a critical issue.

### Category field

TPP sometimes provides a category value, whereas we never provide one.
```json
"category": [
    {
        "coding": [
            {
                "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/diagnostic-service-sections",
                "code": "PAT",
                "display": "Pathology (gross & histopath, not surgical)"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

_Martin_: Assume that this was a decision within the mapping, but would slightly prefer [the field][gpconnect_laboratory_category] to be populated with Laboratory as per the spec.
Given that the GP2GP XML already specifies `<code code="16488004" codeSystem="2.16.840.1.113883.2.1.3.2.4.15" displayName="laboratory reporting">` this wouldn't be making up information.
This hasn't been raised by NMEs though, so can be classified as a nice to have.

### Performer field

TPP sometimes (e.g. `c200000000000000_ce6c000000000000`) provides a performer value, whereas we never provide one.
```json
"performer": [
    {
        "actor": {
            "reference": "Organization/f000000000000000_c746100000000000"
        }
    }
]
```

_Martin_: Looking at the example for `c200000000000000_ce6c000000000000`, the same performer is specified against the `DiagnosticReport.performer` and `ProcedureRequest.performer` fields.
This seems suspicious, and should be investigated at the TPP GPConnect level first.


### Outstanding unmatched DiagnosticReports

These appear to have not matched because the specimen matching wasn't successful.

_Adrian_: Adrian to investigate why these DiagnosticReports weren't matched between the two outputs.

## Specimen

TPP Entries = 17 vs PS Entries = 16

### Inconsistent note field

EMIS Entry c200000000000000_1f6c000000000000_1 vs PS Entry c200000000000000_1f6c000000000000_1
(accessionIdentifier: HA2101111C)

Note is appearing inconsistently on both TPP and PS side.
In this case, it appears on TPP side without any entry on PS side. XML also doesn't include anything.

_Martin_: This example hasn't been provided within the GP2GP output.
Looking at TPP, the value is only viewable when drilling into the specimens EDIFACT message.

### Unmatched entries

MISSING Entry: EMIS entry with ID c200000000000000_6f6c000000000000_1 has not been found in the PS enties
- Potential Specimen match C515E756-2473-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0
- Potential Specimen match C5137647-2473-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0
For some missing specimen in TPP there are quite a few entries with the same accessionIdentifier values which PS identifies as potential matches.

_Martin_: Reviewed the data within TPP, and observed that there was strangely input data. Martin to go away and match the data himself to get an idea of what's going on.

## Observation

### DIFF: Array Property resource.performer does not have equal length with PS property resource.performer (2 != 1)

TPP include a reference to the organisation within the `Observation.performer` array.

_Martin_: This should be the okay, this is only a difference in the way the data is being returned.
Same information is available in both outputs, in slightly different forms via relationships.

### DIFF: TPP Value of resource.valueQuantity.unit does not match PS Property (mU/L != m{U}/L)

m{U}/L is specified as the unit within the `ObservationStatement / value [@unit]`.

_Martin_: We don't make any attempt to convert the value that comes from GP2GP.
Suspect that these two are different forms of the same unit of measure.
If TPP are providing different values that's up to them.

### NEW: Property code is not present in the EMIS data (PS Value : [iU]/L)

PS Adaptor
```json
{
    "code" : "m{U}/L",
    "system" : "http://unitsofmeasure.org",
    "unit" : "m{U}/L",
    "value" : 12
}
```

TPP
```json
{
    "value": 12,
    "unit": "mU/L"
}
```

XML:
```xml
<value xsi:type="PQ" value="12" unit="m{U}/L"/>
```

_Martin_: Reading the MiM, we don't see any reason why this is wrong based on that and the GP2GP output.
Unitsofmeasure is the correct system.

### NEW: Property comparator is not present in the EMIS data (PS Value : <=)

PS Adaptor
```json
"referenceRange" : [
    {
        "high" : {
            "comparator" : "<=",
            "value" : 14
        },
        "low" : {
            "comparator" : "<=",
            "value" : 10
        }
    }
],
```

TPP
```json
"referenceRange": [
    {
        "low": {
            "value": 10
        },
        "high": {
            "value": 14
        }
    }
]
```

GP2GP:
```xml
<referenceInterpretationRange classCode="OBS" moodCode="EVN.CRT">
  <value>
    <low value="10.0"/>
    <high value="14.0"/>
  </value>
</referenceInterpretationRange>
```

_Martin_: This PS Adaptor output looks wrong.
[Low][referenceRange.low] and High should be SimpleQualtities which can't have a comparator.
The MiM should contain a complete list of different comparator values.
Believes this issue has come up before, and there should be a fix already.

[referenceRange.low]: http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/observation-definitions.html#Observation.referenceRange.low

### NEW: Property interpretation is not present in the TPP data

```json
"interpretation" : {
    "coding" : [
        {
            "code" : "L",
            "display" : "Low",
            "system" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0078"
        }
    ],
    "text" : "Below low reference limit"
},
```

_Martin_: To speak with TPP as issue is with them, PS Adaptor behaviour looks correct.

###Â MISSING: Property text is missing in PS Entry (TPP Value : Plasma TSH level)

TPP:
```json
"code": {
    "coding": [
        {
            "extension": [
                {
                    "url": "https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/Extension-coding-sctdescid",
                    "extension": [
                        {
                            "url": "descriptionId",
                            "valueId": "2575751000000115"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
            "code": "1022801000000102",
            "display": "Plasma TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) level"
        }
    ],
    "text": "Plasma TSH level"
},
```

PS:
```
"code" : {
   "coding" : [
      {
         "code" : "1022801000000102",
         "display" : "Plasma TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) level",
         "extension" : [
            {
               "extension" : [
                  {
                     "url" : "descriptionId",
                     "valueId" : "2575751000000115"
                  }
               ],
               "url" : "https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/Extension-coding-sctdescid"
            }
         ],
         "system" : "http://snomed.info/sct"
      }
   ]
},
```

GP2GP:
```xml
<code code="XaELW" codeSystem="2.16.840.1.113883.2.1.3.2.4.14" displayName="Plasma TSH level">
    <originalText>Plasma TSH level</originalText>
    <translation code="1022801000000102" codeSystem="2.16.840.1.113883.2.1.3.2.4.15" displayName="Plasma TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) level"/>
    <translation code="442X.00" codeSystem="2.16.840.1.113883.2.1.6.2" displayName="Plasma TSH level"/>
</code>
```

_Martin_: The `originalText` has gone missing, and shouldn't be dropped.
Note however, that the behaviour of the codable concepts has changed since this comparison, and could already have been fixed. 
PS Adaptor should now also include an additional `userSelected` coding.
UPDATE: After reviewing the behaviour of the PS Adaptor, as of 2023-08-20, the text is now correctly populated.

### MISSING: Property text is missing in PS Entry (Emis Value : < 4)

PS Adaptor
```json
"referenceRange" : [
    {
        "high" : {
            "comparator" : "<=",
            "value" : 4
        }
    }
],
```

TPP
```json
"referenceRange": [
    {
        "text": "< 4"
    }
]
```

_Martin_: On initial inspection, TPP output looks correct based on TPP UI.
However GP2GP and PS behaviour mapping looks correct too. Needs further investigation.

### MISSING: Property related is missing in PS Entry

TPP:
```json
"related": [
    {
        "type": "has-member",
        "target": {
            "reference": "Observation/5000000000000000_7dfb070000000000"
        }
    }
]
```

Not sure why the related is missing from the PS Adaptor version?!  Suppose, PS Adaptor doesn't think it is a header.

_Martin_: Looking at the GP2GP message for `5000000000000000_7dfb070000000000`, there doesn't appear to be any way to link up Comment Note `5000000000000000_6dfb070000000000`.
There wouldn't be a way for us to create this relation within the Adaptor.
Curious as to how EMIS would handle this TPP patient.

### Mapping of laboratory results quite different between the two.

Hard to match up these because the way lab results are generated is so different between TPP and PS.

- 52 Comment Note from the Patient Switcher.  A lot of these are coded as "laboratory" within TPP.

_Martin_: This looks like a bug for now.
Looking at `5000000000000000_00fb070000000000`, the comment being pulled out is the whole of the `AGGREGATE COMMENT`.
Looking at the PS Adaptor output, the equivilent `C515E71E-2473-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0` pulls out only the last line, and creates a separate `Comment note` with the full AGGREGATE COMMENT contents.

- 16 Laboratory Test Observable from the Patient Switcher (e.g. `C515E725-2473-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0`). However within the TPP, they appear to be created as 16 Comment Notes instead (e.g. `9300000000000000_0f1e640000000000`).

  - Identified that for an AGGREGATE COMMENT SET, we are duplicating that across multiple other Observations.
  - Simply using the AGGREGATE COMMENT SET comment type, is not sufficient to differentiate the different types of content.
    It is somewhat of a catch all.


### Test result comment getting cut off

- C515E712 comment = "second day after the expected menstruation".

Beginning of sentence is cut off for some reason.


### Not within TPP extract, but unclear why.

- `C51D1317-2473-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0` - "HIV Negative"
- `C51D1345-2473-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0` - "Fluorescent treponemal antibody test"

### Within TPP extract, but marked as a DiagnosticReport

- `C513762C-2473-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0`

### Unsure what's going on with this one.

Unclear where it is getting its data from, and also unclear why "laboratory" category is added twice.

I suspect this is a bug within a PS Adaptor, but would need to do more investigation.

- C5137632


### Degraded entries

There are 4 degraded entries within the PS Adaptor that have no originalText copied over, e.g. `Chlamydia Positive`.

- C51D131B
- C51D1332
- C51D1333
- C51D1345
