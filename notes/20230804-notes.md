# Document reference 

## Potential issues in adaptor mapping 

### Missing Document reference

**d100000000000000_b6ba200000000000_19ac400000000000** doesn't seem to appear in the PS output or the HL7.

_Martin H_: Appears to be a discrepancy between the GP2GP output from TPP and GP Connect. We've performed some investigation of why this item wasn't being generated within GP2GP, however couldn't identify a specific cause.

### Global 

All document references from the adaptor output have the losing practice as the custodian (taken from the initial request) is this correct?

### Author field

There are instances where, the author fields of documents do not match. For example:

- **F36BAB44-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0 vs 9200000000000000_fb7d200000000000_19ac400000000000**, where the author is missing from TPP

_Martin H_: Suspect that TPP doesn't have the ability to record a specific author, so it is plausible that we shouldn't be using an author field. Recommend going to Neill, for a decision on whether it is more clincically safe to include a wrong author, or more safe to have no author value.

- **c610000000000000_c853000000000000_19ac400000000000 vs F36BAB3A-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0**, where an `author.display` exists in TPP but it is different to the author referenced by the adaptor. The adaptor pulls the author from `NarrativeStatement / participant / agentRef[0] / id [@root]` or else `ehrComposition / Participant2` is this correct? 

_Martin H_: Unable to verify one way or another which author is correct based on looking at both the HL7 and the from SystemOne.

### Related field

We do not populate the related field. Is it possible for us to determine the value of this from the HL7?

- **c610000000000000_c853000000000000_19ac400000000000 vs F36BAB3A-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0** has a context related field for a referral request.

_Martin H_: Reviewed the HL7 output to see if there is _any_ way of linking the referral, but couldn't.

- **d100000000000000_a6ba200000000000_19ac400000000000 vs F3693A30-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0**. TPP has a context.related for a ProcedureRequest

_Martin H_: Reviewed the HL7 output to see if there is _any_ way of linking the referral, but couldn't.

- **7f00000000000000_47a9000000000000_19ac400000000000 vs F3693A34-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0**. TPP has a context.related for an observation.

### Description field

- When the related field is present the description tag is different to the Adaptors (examples above)

_Martin H_: Unable to match to the related field. "Neither better nor worse"

- When it's a medical drawing the description field prepended with medical drawing - **7f00000000000000_87a9000000000000_19ac400000000000 + F3693A32-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0**

_Martin H_: GP2GP conversion looks better from a non-medical perspective.

- Sometimes the description is different but has the same information - **c610000000000000_a853000000000000_19ac400000000000 + F36BAB3E-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0**

_Martin H_: Just coming out of SystemOne differently in GP2GP vs GPConnect

### Time zones 

We are expecting a UK time zone even though it is not explicitly stated in the HL7 time, why? Are TPP sending UK zoned times? If so, do EMIS do it?

- **c610000000000000_2853000000000000_19ac400000000000 + F36BAB42-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0** have different time zones

_Martin H_: Will investigate whether there is a requirement specifying what timezone we should be outputting times in.

## TPP Mapping differences / unknown significance

### Absent attachments have both URL and title

This is intentional to make it possible to extract data from a GP2GP placeholder. Without a URL the NME cannot download it. 

- **9200000000000000_3c7d200000000000_19ac400000000000 vs F36BAB4A-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0**
- **9200000000000000_3b7d200000000000_19ac400000000000 + F36BAB4C-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0**

_Martin H_: No complaints.

### type.coding field

We are populating the type.coding field from the code element in the HL7 and TPP are not.

_Martin H_: In short, keep our behaviour. Types aren't coded in TPP, so suspect that TPP have hardcoded the code value within GP2GP. Assuming it's meaninful let's not loose it.

### type.text field 

TPP will sometimes use a category or "{category} - description" for the type.text field. Where the category doesn't seem to be in the HL7. Whereas, the adaptor uses the code element (display name or original text). 

 - **d100000000000000_a6ba200000000000_19ac400000000000 vs F3693A30-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0**
 - **7f00000000000000_47a9000000000000_19ac400000000000 vs F3693A34-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0**
 - **c610000000000000_8853000000000000_19ac400000000000 vs F36BAB3B-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0**

_Martin H_: It's different, but this is all we are given from GP2GP output.

### MIME types

The TPP output has different MIME types in the FHIR and HL7, 

- *text/rtf*  in the HL7 vs *application/rtf* in the FHIR
- *application/msword* in the HL7 and *application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document* (docx)
- *text/plain* in the HL7 and *application/octet-stream* in the FHIR, this should still work it just seemed unusual because the doc is plain text (also missing URL, see below) - **d100000000000000_a6ba200000000000_19ac400000000000 vs F3693A30-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0**
- *text/html* in the HL7 and *application/octet-stream* in the FHIR - **c610000000000000_a853000000000000_19ac400000000000 vs F36BAB40-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0**

_Martin H_: They are both in the [list of valid MIME types].

[list of valid MIME types]: https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml

### Missing content URL 

URL is not present in TPP FHIR, but not placeholder in HL7?:

- **d100000000000000_a6ba200000000000_19ac400000000000 vs F3693A30-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0**
- _Martin H_: GP Connect problem. 

### Description information in plan statement

There is information in the TPP FHIR documentReference.description field that is only present in the HL7 plan statement.

- **d100000000000000_a6ba200000000000_19ac400000000000 vs F3693A30-2474-11EE-808B-AC162D1F16F0**  
- - _Martin H_: extra information in the GP connect output that is not in the narrative statement in GP2GP HL7.
